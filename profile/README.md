# Tachyon

**Tachyon** is the next evolution of [Zcash](https://z.cash/)’s shielded transaction cryptography, designed to eliminate core scalability bottlenecks inherent to [Zerocash](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/349)-derived privacy protocols.

## Overview
A  set of upgrades to the Zcash shielded payment protocol, designed to boost scalability and usability while preserving privacy. The project introduces improvements like out-of-band payments, shielded transaction aggregation, and privacy-enhanced syncing—all in a backwards-compatible way. Each upgrade can be deployed independently, providing immediate benefits to wallets and validators, and paving the way for larger or more frequent blocks. Tachyon is designed to work alongside other Zcash protocol enhancements, with a focus on high-quality, privacy-protecting code.
